# Tools to Manage Dopamine and Improve Motivation & Drive

## Summary of Dopamine and Serotonin

### Dopamine's Positive Effects

- Closely linked to our sense of motivation
- It can enhance our depth of focus and lower our threshold for taking action toward specific goals
- When our dopamine levels are elevated, we tend to focus our attention on outward goals — the things we want — and we feel motivated to pursue them
- Dopamine levels shape our perception of life, our emotions, and how capable we perceive ourselves to be

### Effects of Low Dopamine

- Feel unmotivated
- Derive less pleasure from pursuits
- Feel physically tired

### Serotonin's Effects

- Associated not so much with "wanting" but with feelings of well-being about what we already have

## Part I: Managing Dopamine to Sustain Motivation

### Baseline Dopamine Importance

It is critically important to maintain sufficient levels of baseline dopamine to sustain day-to-day motivation. We don't want the baseline too low or too high.

### Ways to Establish Baseline Dopamine

1. Viewing early morning sunlight for 10-30 minutes daily
   - Causes the release of dopamine
   - If done consistently, it will also increase levels of gene expression for certain dopamine receptors
2. 1-3 minute cold shower (Wim Hof breathing too?)
   - This is known to increase baseline dopamine for hours dramatically.
3. Eat tyrosine-rich foods
   - Why?
     - Tyrosine is an amino acid and a building block of dopamine
     - A diet rich in tyrosine will sustain your body's natural dopamine production
   - Food sources of Tyrosine
     - Red meats
     - Nuts
     - Hard fermented cheese
4. Avoid melatonin supplements
   - They can decrease dopamine levels
   - Can disrupt normal sleep patterns
5. Avoid viewing bright lights between 10PM-4AM
   - This is **essential**, as it has been shown to activate a brain region called the habenula and drastically reduce the amount of circulating dopamine in your system

## Part II: Managing Dopamine Peaks

### A Caution

If you don't manage the dopamine associated with the pursuit and your wins, your dopamine baseline and the dopamine you experience from reaching milestones will start to diminish over time, and you'll feel far less satisfaction from, well, everything.

### How to Manage Peaks

1. Use (Randomly) an Intermittent Reward Timing (RIRT)
   - The key is to celebrate your wins, but do not celebrate every win. When you succeed in reaching a milestone, sometimes enjoy that; other times (at random), just keep going.
   - Even better, associate "winning" with the effort process itself. That's the holy grail of dopamine management for success.
   - It will make everything easier and more pleasurable, without the peaks and valleys of dopamine that external-reward-driven people experience
2. Remember that Dopamine is Subjective
   - Don't underestimate the extent to which the dopamine system and the sense of whether you are on the right track are under your cognitive control
   - The prefrontal cortex (the executive control portion of your brain) is part of the dopamine pathway and provides subjective, top-down control (a "belief effect") for motivation levels.
   - These are not placebo or small effects. Telling yourself you are moving toward your goals is a huge stimulator of dopamine release — and under your control.
3. Spotlighting
   - Dopamine interacts with the visual system
   - Physically focusing your visual attention on a specific point (or "spotlight") will help maintain focus during bouts of goal work
   - When you focus on a particular point, a medley of neurochemicals (dopamine, epinephrine and others) are recruited and put you into a state of readiness and clear focus.
4. Don't Layer Too Many Sources of Dopamine
   - Stacking too many dopmanine-triggering sources (pre-workout energy drinks, plus music, plus friends/social connection, plus nootropics, etc) causes a crash afterward
   - This crash undermines our longer-term motivation and continued drive
   - Try to limit the stacking of these sources and switch them up
5. Supplement to Microspike Dopamine
   - There are compounds sold over the counter that potently increase dopamine but not so much that they cause the problems associated with illicit or prescription (Rx) drugs that do the same
   - Supplement options
     - L-Tyrosine (500-1000mg)
       - Taken 30 minutes before a mental or physical work bout will increase focus and motivation
     - 500mg of L-Tyrosine and 300mg of Alpha-GPC
       - Take prior to a hard workout or focused cognitive work
       - Don't do it every day to keep in line with rule 4 above
     - 300mg Alpha-GPC, 500mg Phenylethylamine and (sometimes) 500mg L-Tyrosine
       - My favorite preworkout or precognitive-work-bout supplement
   - A note on these supplements
     - Don't take these after 2-3 p.m. if you intend to sleep that night
     - If you have bipolar depression or any other dopamine-sensitive condition, be very cautious with these dopamine-enhancing compounds
     - Those with ADHD may need MD-prescribed Ritalin, Adderall or other Rx drugs, but those without ADHD should avoid these Rx drugs merely for "recreational" focus; they are powerful and can lead to dependency.
