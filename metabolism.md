# Metabolism

- Thyroid hormone requires selenium, tyroseine, and iodine
- Selenium can be gained through brazil nuts better than any other food
- Eating with 2 hours of sleep will reduce potential growth hormone gains found in the early deep stages of sleep

## Increasing Growth Hormone through Exercise

- Don't eat before or during  weight training exercise since raised blood glucose flatlines the potential for growth hormone gains
- 10min warmup of actual body temperature and not just muscles
- 60-75 minutes strength training or endurance (he did include endurance)
- Exercise not quite to failure
- Cooling body right after will increase growth hormone 300-500 percent that day and the night after

## Increasing Growth Hormone through Supplements

- L-Citraline (best option) can be taken to increase growth hormone, but it does not stack with the exercise methods as well

## Increasing Growth Hormone through Hyperthermia

- 20-30 minutes or so in 175-210F sauna can increase growth hormone 16X

## Increasing Growth Hormone through Fasting

- Fasting can increase growth hormone by 2X, which is less than other methods, though still significant
